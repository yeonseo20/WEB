    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some server-side website deployments, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.

      Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
